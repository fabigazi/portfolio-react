            <p>
                It is easier to make a list of things that I don't like. I try to find the joy
                in almost every activity. I have been fortunate to try many things and therfore
                enjoy many outdoor activities such as running, soccer, skiing, snowboarding and 
                many others. I also enjoy mental chalenges like piano, rubix cubes, sudoku and 
                riddles. Finally I enjoy keeping my computer skills sharp with personal projects
                such as game making, Convininece applications, and IT and computer organization.
